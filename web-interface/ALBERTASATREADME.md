## Dependencies

### Rust

- Latest Rust stable should work.

### npm

- Use node version 16 for stable result. I've tried other versions, and there
are issues when using newer versions.

## Usage

- Navigate to the `www` directory using `cd www`
- Run the webserver using `npm run start`
- By default, the webserver is hosted in `http://localhost:8080`
